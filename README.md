# convertCtoCPP
coursera exercise of converting a C program to C++ program

There are 2 programs in this project, one in C, one in C++. They both compute the sum of a data set of integer values. 
The C program (original.c) does this with an array, the C++ program (sumation.cpp) uses a vector.
Both use an outside sum function to do this and reference the original data set in memory instead of passing by value.

To run either program from command line:
1. C Program
- type "make original"
- type "./original"

2. C++ Program
- type "make summation"
- type "./summation"
